#She is invited to enter a to-do item straight away

# She types "Buy peacock feathers" into a text box 

#When she hits enter, the page updates, and now the page lists
# "1: Buy peacock feathers " as an item in a to-do list

#There is still a text box inviting her to add another item. She 
#enters "Use peacock feathers to make a fly"

#The page updates again, and now shows both items on her list
